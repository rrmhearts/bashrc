## comment and uncomment selection of lines

# For those tasks I use most of the time block selection.
# 
# Put your cursor on the first # character, press CtrlV (or CtrlQ for gVim), and go down until the last commented line and press x, that will delete all the # characters vertically.
# 
# For commenting a block of text is almost the same:
# 
# 1.    First, go to the first line you want to comment, press CtrlV. This will put the editor in the VISUAL BLOCK mode.
# 2.    Then using the arrow key and select until the last line
# 3.    Now press ShiftI, which will put the editor in INSERT mode and then press #. This will add a hash to the first line.
# 4.    Then press Esc (give it a second), and it will insert a # character on all other selected lines.
# 
# For the stripped-down version of vim shipped with debian/ubuntu by default, type : s/^/# in the third step instead.
